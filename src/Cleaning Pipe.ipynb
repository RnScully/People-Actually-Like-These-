For my first few reads they’ve started off quite light, however within the first chapter this was <u>dark</u>! We got deaths and treachery, and I was <b>here for it/</b> We got more characters and they were SO good! We had Moody, Krum, Fleur, Cedric Diggory and Winky!. Now this is one of the very very few times that I have watched the films before I’ve read the book (no judging here) and out of the four books so far this one has the most differences, but the book was <u>so</u> much better!<br><br>There’s such a dark atmosphere to this, and I was often questioning what was happening. I adored the backstory of Crouch and his family I was just like WHAT IS HAPPENING! While this is getting darker there are still fun moments, my favourite being <b>Pigwidgeon</b> what a lovable little owl! Not only this but we got more glimpses of Sirius and I loved how protective he was over Harry. This is the first glimpses I’ve seen in to Ron and Hermione have jealous spats and not only that but Hermione starting S.P.E.W (SPEW?!).<br><br>What I <b>liked?</b><br>- The Quidditch world cup, I loved that everyone had to dress up to try and pass as muggles, also the mascots of each teams were an added bonus<br>- Hermione calling Malfoy a “Twitchy little ferret” ahahahahahahaha!<br>- Nifflers!<br>- The Pensieve and seeing all of the memories, it was so well done.<br>- Everyone coming out of the wand!<br>- Dumbledores speech for/about Diggory. <i>My heart!</i><br>- Rita Skeeter and all of her little secrets!<br>- THE BUILD UP WAS SO GOOD!<br><br>What I <b>didn’t like?</b><br>- Friendships being broken for such a long period of time… <br>- Some parts seemed to drag ever so slightly for me<br><br>Overall I didn’t expect was how emotional I found everything?! I mean I was close to tears at some points which I was very surprised at. I’m really looking forward to starting ORDER OF THE PHOENIX, I’m hoping we still get all of the darkness and lots of new characters!

Who knows ? Harry Potter grows up and becomes a boy who has to take the responsibility on his shoulders, he never wants to be selected, he never wants glory and prestige, yet the world turns against him anyway.I love that this book isn't a children's book anymore, in my opinion, it becomes hastily intense and has more dimensions than J.K. Rowling had ever intended. She did a great job when she wrote this book, I could see her intention for the book to be a mature one and she made the right decision for doing that. I'm so pround of her and so she becomes my favorire author EVER !\\n“If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.” \\n\\n“It matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be.” \\nNot only this book is full of adventures, but it hides some messages for you to discover. Isn't it the best way to teach our children via books ? Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire has everything I've asked for since the first time I read. Until now, the book is like a gem and I think of it as my treasure because it's so precious my eyes hurt to look at.Many things happen in this book such as a tragedy and deprecation, but it's the way our lives go on, right ? So I embraced this book like a teddy bear and told myself that perhaps something really bad would happen, but it's just mishaps and it would pass like a rainy day.\\n“Remember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory.”\\n #TeamKrumioneMore at http://goo.gl/kNcx2n\",\n",

       " 'Act 4 of 7, gents! And I’m stuck somewhere betwixt 4 and 5 stars for this one, so I’ll just write this review, pop on back to the beginning and smack a rating on this bad boy. (Disclaimer: I am on Hour 26 post-wisdom teeth surgery, on some painkillers no one should turn their nose up at, and desperate for solid food and human interaction. So in other words, bear with me, because this may be...somethin’.)https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...Okay, let’s start with our characters. I always gotta discuss the same collection of several. Both Harry and Ron are pretty consistently eh characters for me (except in the first book, in which I really enjoyed Harry). Here, instead of being eh, I found them...annoying? It drove me absolutely insane that Harry kept procrastinating his clues - like no yeah, do your Divination homework the night it’s assigned, but please put the life-or-death clue off to the side for now. And don’t even get me started on their constant, needless bickering. Ugh. HOW ARE YOU BOTH SOMEHOW EQUALLY ANNOYING HERE?Neville, on the other hand? Cemented his status as a fave o’ mine. His backstory is great. He really deserves to be in Gryffindor, the brave li’l guy, and I just want to give him a big hug. Snape, meanwhile....Well, somehow he outdoes himself here. I just don’t know how I’m going to hold onto this rant until book 7. God, you guys, get ready for a tsunami of anger, I guess.And let’s discuss that feminist message, shall we? I, first off, love that my perhaps-all-time-favorite character Hermione gets political as hell in this one. Mad respect, girl. And for a cause that she’s laughed at for, even one that would make her life far, far easier in every means if she just backed off it! (I’m seeing some parallels to feminism here….) Plus, her defeat of Rita Skeeter, who taunted her for her appearance and reduced her meaning as a person to the boys she spent time with, is just amazing.And don’t even get me started on the representation of women in professional sports in this book! Fabulous enough that almost half of the Gryffindor quidditch team is female, but the fact that there are women competitors in the Quidditch World Cup? Amazing! There’s no underestimating the empowerment that representation lent to young, female readers who dreamed of being athletes.If only this wonderful treatment of women - and we know that Rowling is a tried-and-true feminist - extended to the Triwizard Tournament. But alas, all we get is...Fleur. Fleur’s only trait is her beauty (cough cough, reminds me of someone we know, cough cough, CHO F*CKING CHANG), she (like Rita Skeeter to Hermione) is reduced to the boys she spends time with/thereby must be flirting with (Cedric, the Ravenclaw quidditch captain), and, worst of all, she’s not a good competitor. She gives an eh performance in the first task, receives pity-points in the second, and is ignored and eliminated in the third. Ms. Rowling, my love, couldn’t she at least use her looks cunningly to distract her opponent? If you were only going to give us one girl competitor out of four, couldn’t she at least be, well, good?There were fewer stupid mistakes in this one, but there were still some. One being that somehow magic-less mermaids painted pictures of themselves on a rock...underwater. Unless they’re sourcing that fancy schmancy under-da-sea paint, they should not be able to do that. Also, the search for Sirius is never mentioned by the many (many, many, many, MANY) members of the Ministry of Magic we are CONSTANTLY seeing in this book. Or by Rita Skeeter. Which doesn’t make sense, because that search was a big f*cking deal. (And don’t you think ol’ Skeeter would want to bring up that failing when she’s writing inflammatory articles about Hogwarts and/or the Ministry?)But this comes down to the same thing all these reviews come down to: the world. Goblet of Fire gives us the biggest look into the Wizarding World since Sorcerer’s Stone (Quidditch World Cup! Triwizard Tournament! The operations of the Ministry of Magic!), and because I love looking at this world so flippin’ much (plus fewer teeny errors) I have to give this a high rating.Bottom line: definitely better than the second and third, and maybe (MAYBE!) an almost-tie for favorite-so-far with the first one. The feminism contains some mixed messages, there are a couple things that don’t make sense, and I still haven’t found a way to kill a fictional character (but when I do, watch your back, Severus). But the world, Hermione, Neville’s story, and a couple other great things overcome all that. This book rocks! Hurray!',\n",
       " \"This was my 3rd time reading, and I've always considered Goblet of Fire to be one of my least favorite books in the series, but I don't know what I was thinking. It was wonderful. So much is being introduced, Voldemort is back. I think my misjudgment is because the movies are more prevalent in my memory and the GoF movie was a pretty disloyal adaptation.\",\n",
       " ' Here be warned: This review contains cursing. Greetings, loved ones, and let us talk of a young witch named Hermione Granger.Hermione is, and always has been, a delight to read. Not necessarily because she\\'s a girl, but because she is the only character amongst those 14 year olds who actually has a good head on her shoulders. When I was young and gullible, I hated this book. Hated how it killed off Cedric and how bloody the series got afterwards. I hated it enough to renounce the franchize. Now that I re-read it, I still hate it, but for all different reasons. Cedric, on second reading, is as dull as toast (so I guess the movie casting must have been really spot-on). Harry has finally started to shed his unnatural maturity, and has turned just as obnoxious as most boys at 13. Ron is a wanker. So it\\'s beyond me why Hermione hasn\\'t stolen the spotlight here, as she is easily the most relatable character of them all.Let\\'s look at her character - she is from a muggle family, but through hard work she has become the best student in the school. She studies hard, follows the rules, but makes exceptions when the circumstances are right. She comes off as stuck-up at first, but looks after her friends. She keeps her promises, even though she barely has time to take care of herself. And yet Ron is Harry\\'s best friend, not her.Why?Harry and Ron are much closer than Harry and Hermione. In the previous book, Hermione was at odds with the boys not one, but twice, and that put a serious hinge on their friendship. Even so, that doesn\\'t nearly come close to the drama that follows Harry and Ron\\'s falling out in this book. And then, when they do make up, Hermione is once again pushed back as a tercery best friend, even though she sacrificed her efforts and sleep in order to help Harry learn a spell that would save his skinny ass.Hermione is defined by her intelligence. It falls squarely on her shoulders to help the guys when they\\'re in a pickle - whenever they discover that rushing at an obstackle headfirst isn\\'t going to cut it, they turn to her for advice, and she\\'s also acutely aware of issues of inequality. In this book, she actually starts an organisation to help house elves! She stands up for Hagrid when Rita Skeeter takes a sling at him, and she kept Lupin\\'s secret for months in book three simply because she believed he was a good guy! And where do her efforts to promote equality lead to? They\\'re used for comedic relief.It\\'s equally disgusting how little the boys seem to appreciate her. Not only do they refuse to take her seriously, they consider she\\'s for granted. I mean, sure, Harry has lived with his relatives as an upper middle class brat (a much abused middle class brat), but Hermione\\'s parents are dentists and yet she has a better awareness of social issues than he does! Is Rowling trying to suggest that young activism is only for women, because only women seem aware of these issues?But that\\'s not even the worst this book gets. On the Yule Ball, Harry and Ron take ages before they realize Hermione is a girl, and thus, qualified to be a dance partner (obiously, they can\\'t go with each other, altough it would be most logical, what with all the sparks flying among them). Hermione, though, refuses to be taken for granted. She knows she deserves better than to be a go-to girl, and she does - she gets to be Viktor Krum\\'s date, and she damn well got someone who appreciates her! But are her friends happy for her? No, they\\'re shocked, and in Ron\\'s case, offended, that she dared *gasp* make plans without them! Ron goes as far as to make a scene - in which he (not for the first time) makes Hermione cry. This was supposed to establish some beginnings of the love between Hermione and Ron, but, quite frankly, it just makes Ron look like a wanker. After Rita Skeeter\\'s article, Hermione becomes the target for bullying which, in some cases, turns rather dangerous. Grown-up witches send her hate mail packed with all sorts of deadly stuff, one of which makes the skin of her hands fall off. Ron\\'s commentary? She should have seen it coming, messing around with the paparazzi like that. I bet the bumrag was happy she got punished for liking Krum. But that\\'s not even what\\'s most disturbing about this thing - it\\'s that witches who have never even met Hermione before are willing to take Skeeter\\'s word for it, even if the woman\\'s as trustworthy as a snake. Even Mrs. Weasley, whose own husband got blackened twice in \"The Daily Prophet\", believes her! Nice message for female solidarity, Ms Rowling, real subtle.Again, I ask, why can\\'t Hermione be the hero of these series? I don\\'t think I\\'m alone in thinking it could be so much better. ',\n",

Not a very encouraging model for French girls or girls in general. I mean, I know Harry always has to win, but perhaps it would have been a wee bit better and even more suspenseful if Fleur had placed a bit higher. A note about the movie: it was FRUSTRATING! The movie skipped easily half of the book or more - no quidditch at all :( - and I don\\'t know how folks could have followed the action without having read the book because to my eyes, there were a lot of nonsequitors (like the poor editing of the death eater scene following the Quidditch World Cup.)

       " \"This is by far, so far, the darkest book of them all. Grim is the beginning of the book, grimmer is the foreshadowing and grimmest is the ordeal through which Harry alone survives.Harry's trick of conveying only what he sees or dreams of is well poised in the book's narrative. It's the balance of the known and unknown that is intriguing. So many things happen.One can barely cope with the events in the book. And we have to sort them according to what our theories are. Harry Potter is extraordinary in his ordinariness. Magic is so innately superficial in book 4, that's it's used as a tool rather than a luxury. That's it, from me.\",\n",

       " 'Now THAT\\'S a book! The groove that J.K. Rowling starts to find in HP 3 is fully realized in 4. Partly it\\'s that the kids (and therefore the readers) are getting older so she can delve into more adult, complex themes and situations, and partly it\\'s that I think she\\'s really finding her voice. We finally got our very own HP\\'s, I am happy to report, and it\\'s so funny to look at them all side by side b/c of the HUGE leap in size between 3 and 4. Then they get a little tricky b/c while 4 and 5 look to be about the same length, the font in Order of the Phoenix is much smaller, hence a longer book. I just started that one and it honestly feels longer already. More of a book book and less of a fun afternoon\\'s diversion. But I like these books as they get both darker and longer.But to focus on Goblet of Fire specifically for a moment...again, not that I think I can bring anything new to the table in discussing these books. Nevertheless, I\\'ll throw a few ideas out there just for your reading pleasure. One thing that struck me, as I mentioned before, was the increasing maturity and complexity of situations and themes. Clearly having someone die is a huge deal and I found that whole series of events really moving this time around. I may have last time as well, but I don\\'t remember. In a way, though, some of the more complex issues feel jarring next to the goofy concepts she originally created. Calling non-magical people \"Muggles,\" for instance. It\\'s just a stupid word and yes, it sounds funny and makes kids laugh, but sometimes it\\'s hard to take all these people seriously. \"Mud-bloods\" on the other hand is vicious and definitely drives the point home. I just wonder if she was to do it over again if some of those terms or ideas would change a bit. Yes, we\\'d all like to revisit what we did/wrote when we were less sure of ourselves and our voices and ideas, but of course we can\\'t and neither can she. And what do I know? She claims she always knew what would happen to Harry, so maybe for her \"Muggle\" is the ideal word.Since, as usual, I find it impossible to discuss the books without referencing the films, let me just say that although I hated Dobby in the movie (2?) and was glad to see him mostly cut from subsequent screen incarnations, I really loved him in this one. The dialogue is actually quite funny and Hermione\\'s whole S.P.E.W. thing just cracks me up. Yes, I know a lot of people hate it and find it annoying and whatever, but I love it. Of course she would have a cause like that. That\\'s who she is! And poor Winky. They\\'re weird creatures (and OH how I love Kreacher in the next one!) and I can\\'t decide whether I am with Hermione or everyone else on their \"plight.\" Either way, I like that they exist; they provide a bit of moral ambiguity in a world that is mostly cleanly divided between good and evil. You might wonder about people, but for the most part they end up squarely one or the other. Other than Snape - another great piece of moral ambiguity whose complexity grows from book to book.I also continue to marvel at Rowling\\'s ability to write about the teenage mind. Ron and Harry\\'s fight is spot on, as are Hermione\\'s various reactions to it. And oh these poor boys having to ask the girls to the feast. I wish I had known when I was in middle school how truly hard it was for boys to talk to girls like that. Although I probably wouldn\\'t have cared, being the good self-involved teenger that I was. I still want to go to Hogwarts.',\n",

For my first few reads they’ve started off quite light, however within the first chapter this was <u>dark</u>! We got deaths and treachery, and I was <b>here for it/</b> We got more characters and they were SO good! We had Moody, Krum, Fleur, Cedric Diggory and Winky!. Now this is one of the very very few times that I have watched the films before I’ve read the book (no judging here) and out of the four books so far this one has the most differences, but the book was <u>so</u> much better!<br/><br/>There’s such a dark atmosphere to this, and I was often questioning what was happening. I adored the backstory of Crouch and his family I was just like WHAT IS HAPPENING! While this is getting darker there are still fun moments, my favourite being <b>Pigwidgeon</b> what a lovable little owl! Not only this but we got more glimpses of Sirius and I loved how protective he was over Harry. This is the first glimpses I’ve seen in to Ron and Hermione have jealous spats and not only that but Hermione starting S.P.E.W (SPEW?!).<br/><br/>What I <b>liked?</b><br/>- The Quidditch world cup, I loved that everyone had to dress up to try and pass as muggles, also the mascots of each teams were an added bonus<br/>- Hermione calling Malfoy a “Twitchy little ferret” ahahahahahahaha!<br/>- Nifflers!<br/>- The Pensieve and seeing all of the memories, it was so well done.<br/>- Everyone coming out of the wand!<br/>- Dumbledores speech for/about Diggory. <i>My heart!</i><br/>- Rita Skeeter and all of her little secrets!<br/>- THE BUILD UP WAS SO GOOD!<br/><br/>What I <b>didn’t like?</b><br/>- Friendships being broken for such a long period of time… <br/>- Some parts seemed to drag ever so slightly for me<br/><br/>Overall I didn’t expect was how emotional I found everything?! I mean I was close to tears at some points which I was very surprised at. I’m really looking forward to starting ORDER OF THE PHOENIX, I’m hoping we still get all of the darkness and lots of new characters!
